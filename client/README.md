# ohia.ai App Client

This README has a lot of steps between installation and running instructions. There are three ways you can follow the steps:
1. Follow all the steps in order as written if you would like to run the client on your browser and the iOS simulator.
1. Or you can follow, in order as written, *only* the **required** and **browser** steps if you would like to run the client on your browser.
1. Lastly, you can choose the second option for now, and then later on, you can install the **iOS**-specific steps, in order as written.

### Create the Cordova folder (iOS)
1. This step is only required when creating the `/client/src-cordova` folder for the first time. See **New Project Setup: Create the Cordova folder** below.

### Check that Cordova is properly installed (iOS)
1. Check that ios got installed: `cordova platform ls`.
1. Verify that Cordova is set up properly: `cordova requirements`.

### Install the client project dependencies (required)
1. From the project root directory, install client dependencies: `npm run install:client` (or you may use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) instead).

### Run the app in the browser (browser)
1. See **Running: Run the app in the browser** below.

### Run the app in the iOS simulator (iOS)
1. See **Running: Run the app in the iOS simulator** below.

### Run the app on your iOS device (iOS)
1. See **Running: Run the app on your iOS device** below.

## Running

### Run the client Quasar project in the browser (browser)
1. Run `npm run dev` to view the app in a browser.

### Run the app in the iOS simulator (iOS)

#### Development
1. Run the following command to dev in the iOS simulator: `npm run dev-ios`. Make changes to a file and see your changes appear instantaneously in the simulator.

#### Production
1. Run the following command to create a distribution for iOS: `npm run prod-ios`.

1. In Xcode, with the project workspace now open, select a device in the top left-hand corner, such as the `iPhone 6`, and then click the play button icon to run the project in the simulator.

## New Project Setup

### Create the Quasar folder (required)
1. From the root directory of this project, type: `quasar init client`.
    ```
