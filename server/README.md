# ohia.ai API Server

## Requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 2.7.x
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 10.12.0

## Installation and Execution

1. If you haven't already, switch your terminal to [use Python 2.7](https://github.com/HACC2018/ohia.ai/tree/master/client) and [Node 10.12.0](https://github.com/HACC2018/ohia.ai/tree/master/client).
1. Perform all of the following steps from the project root directory.
1. Run `npm install`. Among other items, you should see "Downloading libtensorflow" and "Building TensorFlow Node.js bindings" run without error in your output.
1. Create a `.env` file by copying the template in `.env.sample`.
1. Source your environment by running: `source .env`.
1. You should now see these variables in your environment by running `env`.
1. Run the server: `npm run dev-server`. You should see the following output:
    ```
    â–¶ npm run dev-server

    > ohia.ai@0.0.1 dev-server /path/to/ohia.ai
    > nodemon server/index.js

    [nodemon] 1.18.4
    [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
    [nodemon] watching: *.*

    ```

## Database

Perform all of the following steps from the project root directory.

### Only During Development
1. If you would like to delete the database, run: `npm run db:rollback`.
1. Then, run the following to restore the database: `npm run db:migrate`.

### Seed Plant and Image Data
1. Create database tables if you haven't already: `npm run db:migrate`.
1. Download a copy of the `plant_meta_vX.csv` from our Google Drive (where **X** is the latest version number) and delete columns after the `updated_at` column (if any).
    1. Open it in Google Sheets and go to File > Download as > Comma-separated values.
1. Download a copy of the `plant_images_vY.csv` from our Google Drive (where **Y** is the latest version number).
1. Connect to the database and enter the password when prompted:
    ```
    psql -d PG_NAME -U PG_USERNAME -h PG_HOST -p PG_PORT
    ```
1. Run the following command to seed the `plants` table:
    ```
    \copy plants FROM '/absolute/path/to/plant_meta_vX.csv' delimiter ',' csv header
    ```
    The expected output is `COPY 44`.
1. Run the following command to seed the `plant_images` table:
    ```
    \copy plant_images FROM '/absolute/path/to/plant_images_vY.csv' delimiter ',' csv header
    ```
    The expected output is `COPY 114`.
