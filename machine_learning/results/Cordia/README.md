## Typical Images
The following is a random sample of Cordia images.

## False Positive Images
The following are the images that the neural network thought were most likely Cordia but actually weren't.

The captions show the correct label for the plant being classified along with the predicted probability for that plant.  Below that is the neural neural network's best guess along with the predicted probability for that guess.

## False Negative Images
The following are the images of Cordia that the neural network did not think was Cordia.  
<p align="center"> <img src="../../../figures/false_negatives/Cordia.png?raw=true"> </p>
The captions show the correct label for the plant being classified (Cordia) along with the predicted probability.  Below that is the neural neural network's best guess along with the predicted probability for that guess.
